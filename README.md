#####Press **CMD + SHIFT + 4 + SPACE** to take screenshot a specific window, menu or dialog.#####

#####Press **CMD + SHIFT + 3** to take a full-screen screenshot.#####

After you've taken a screenshot, you'll receive a notification via the Mac OS X Notification Center, telling you whether the upload was successful or not.

If the upload was successful, then your screenshot has been uploaded and the link has been copied to your clipboard.
